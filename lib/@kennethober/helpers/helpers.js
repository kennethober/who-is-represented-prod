/* Implementation notes: this is sort of a variation on the Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle, using the end-indices of the array to fill in the gaps created by "removing" the randomly chosen indices. This keeps track of how many available choices are left, and which indices have not yet been chosen, without modifying the original array. Each round, after randomly selecting an index (and corresponding element) from the number of choices remaining, the function maps that chosen index to the current last-available index in order to have fewer remaining choices in the next round, but to still be able to select from a contiguous range of indices (by removing the last-available index instead of the chosen index, which now maps to that last-available index). If the same index gets selected in the future, it will therefore map to the index of an element that has not yet been chosen. */
